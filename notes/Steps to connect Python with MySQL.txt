Steps to connect Python with MySQL:

1. Run MySQL Server with docker / docker-compose
	- Navigate to file docker-compose.yaml
	- then run in Terminal: docker-compose up

2. Open MySQLWorkbench and create a connection (Database) to DB-Server
	- In this database, there would be several schemas

3. open python file:
	conn = mysql.connector.connect(
	    host="127.0.0.1",
	    port="3306",
	    database="Learn_SQL_Python", # name of schema in db, not name of MYSQL_DATABASE
	    user='root',
	    password="password"
	)	

--> TO kill the docker container: docker kill [container-name] (container-name could be defined in docker-compose.yaml)
